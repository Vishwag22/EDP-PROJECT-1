20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 1 - IR REMOTE CONTROL LIGHT SWITCH USING CD4017

<ABSTRACT>

The goal is to develop a system that allows users to control home appliances using an IR remote without relying on microprocessors or Arduino.
This system should be simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement.The IR Remote Control Light Switch using CD4017 enhances convenience and
accessibility in home automation by enabling wireless control of lights, reducing the need for manual interaction. This project is particularly
beneficial for individuals with mobility challenges, promoting independence and ease of use in everyday life.

<INTRODUCTION>
Home automation has gained significant attention due to its ability to enhance convenience, energy savings, and control over household appliances. 
An IR remote control light switch offers a user-friendly and cost-effective solution to control lighting systems wirelessly. This project employs 
the CD4017 decade counter IC as the core component to implement a simple and efficient switching mechanism. The IR receiver module captures signals 
from a standard IR remote, which are then interpreted by the CD4017 IC to toggle the lightâ€™s state.
