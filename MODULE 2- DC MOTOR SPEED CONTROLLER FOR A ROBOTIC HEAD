20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 2 - DC MOTOR SPEED CONTROLLER FOR A ROBOTIC HEAD 

<ABSTRACT>

The project is intended for small- to medium-sized robotic Head used in automation, manufacturing, and educational settings.
It targets applications that require precision, cost-effective design, and reliable operation.The use of relays makes
the system simpler and more affordable than alternatives like PWM or transistor-based controllers.This makes it an ideal solution
for small-scale robotic systems or educational purposes. In many industries, especially those involving automation and manufacturing, 
robotic Head perform repetitive tasks.

<INTRODUCTION>

DC motors are essential in various applications, requiring precise speed control for optimal performance. Modern speed control techniques,
such as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and closed-loop systems, offer efficiency and precision compared to traditional methods.
A closed-loop system uses feedback from sensors like encoders to monitor the motor’s speed and employs a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller
to minimize errors and maintain stability under dynamic conditions. This project aims to design an efficient and robust DC motor speed controller, 
emphasizing energy efficiency and adaptability for applications in robotics, manufacturing, transportation, and renewable energy systems.
